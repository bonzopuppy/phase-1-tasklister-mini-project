1. Set up the form submission handler:

When the form is submitted, prevent the default form submission action.
Retrieve the task description from the input field.
Clear the input field for the next task entry.
Call a function to add the task to the task list.

2. Define the function to add a task:

Create a list item (li) element for the new task.
Set the text of the list item to the task description.
Append a delete button to the list item.
Append the list item to the task list (ul element).
Attach an event listener to the delete button to handle task deletion.
Call a function to sort the tasks.

3. Define the function to handle task deletion:

When the delete button is clicked, remove the associated list item from the task list.

4. Define the function to sort tasks:

Convert the list items in the task list into an array.
Sort the array based on the chosen criteria (e.g., alphabetically by task description).
Clear the task list.
Re-add the sorted list items back to the task list.

Initialize the application:

Attach the form submission handler to the form.
If there are pre-existing tasks, sort them on page load.

Pseudo code: 

initializeApp():
    attachEventHandlerToForm()

attachEventHandlerToForm():
    on form submit:
        prevent default submission
        taskDescription = get value from task input field
        clear task input field
        addTask(taskDescription)

addTask(taskDescription):
    listItem = create new list item
    set text of listItem to taskDescription
    deleteButton = create delete button
    attach deleteHandler to deleteButton
    append deleteButton to listItem
    append listItem to task list
    sortTasks()

deleteHandler(event):
    listItem = get parent list item of clicked deleteButton
    remove listItem from task list

sortTasks():
    tasksArray = get list items from task list as array
    sort tasksArray
    clear task list
    for each task in tasksArray:
        append task to task list

on page load:
    sortTasks()
